## Skills

### `using-worktrees`

A Droid-invocable skill for creating isolated git worktrees. Droid will automatically use this skill when:

- Starting feature work that needs isolation from the current workspace
- Before executing implementation plans
- When setting up parallel development environments

**Features:**
- Smart directory selection (`.worktrees/`, `worktrees/`, or `../droid-worktrees/`)
- Safety verification to ensure worktree directories are gitignored
- Auto-detection of project setup commands (npm, cargo, pip, go mod)
- Baseline test verification before starting work

**Manual invocation:**
```
Use the using-worktrees skill to set up an isolated workspace.
```
