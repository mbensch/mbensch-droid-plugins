# Create Jira Initiative

## Initiative Description Format

Every initiative MUST use this exact structure. Do not deviate.

```markdown
## Background
[One paragraph. Strategic context: why this initiative exists, what problem or opportunity it addresses at the business or product level.]

## Objectives
* [Strategic objective this initiative is working toward]
* [Another objective]

## Key Results / Success Metrics
* [Measurable indicator that signals progress or completion]
* [Another metric]

## Out of Scope
[Only if the user explicitly calls out exclusions. Omit this section entirely otherwise.]

## Additional Information / Links
* [Strategy docs, OKRs, stakeholder contacts, related initiatives or epics]
```

### Rules

- **Background**: One paragraph. Strategic-level context only. Do not list epics or implementation details here. Focus on the "why": what business problem, user need, or opportunity is being addressed.
- **Objectives**: 2-4 bullet points. Each objective is a strategic aim ("Improve developer experience to reduce time-to-first-commit for new engineers"). Not tasks.
- **Key Results / Success Metrics**: 2-5 measurable indicators. Quantify where possible ("p50 build time below 2 minutes", "Net Promoter Score increases by 10 points"). If metrics are not yet defined, note that they are TBD and will be tracked via a linked doc.
- **Out of Scope**: Only present when the user explicitly provides exclusions. Never add speculatively.
- **Additional Information / Links**: Include links to strategy documents, OKRs, stakeholder contacts, or related initiatives. Never duplicate information already present in other Jira fields. Omit if empty.
- If any section lacks information, use AskUser to prompt the user rather than leaving placeholders.
- Clear, executive tone throughout -- initiatives are read by stakeholders, not just engineers.
- **Always use Markdown formatting.** The MCP tools convert Markdown to ADF internally. Never use Jira wiki markup (`h2.`, `{{code}}`, `{code}`, `#` for numbered lists). Use `## Heading`, `` `code` ``, triple-backtick fenced code blocks, and `1.` for numbered lists.

### Summary Line

- High-level strategic phrase naming the initiative.
- Not a task or deliverable -- name the effort, not the outcome: "Developer Experience Platform", not "Build developer experience platform".
- Capitalise as a proper name.

## Workflow

### 1. Parse the Request

Extract from the user's message or the context passed from `/jira-create`:
- The strategic driver or business problem (for Background)
- Strategic aims (for Objectives)
- Measurable indicators of success (for Key Results / Success Metrics)
- Explicit exclusions (for Out of Scope)
- Links to strategy docs, OKRs, or related work (for Additional Information)
- Team preference (if mentioned)

### 2. Ask Clarifying Questions

Use AskUser when genuinely ambiguous. Common questions:

- **Missing objectives**: "What is this initiative ultimately trying to achieve for the business or users?"
- **No success metrics**: "How will you measure success? Are there OKRs or KPIs tied to this initiative?"
- **Too tactical**: "This sounds more like an epic than an initiative. Should we create it as an epic instead, or keep it at the initiative level?"
- **Missing team**: "Which team should own this initiative?"
- **Scope**: "Does this initiative span multiple teams or a single team?"

Do NOT ask about format -- the format is fixed.

### 3. Draft the Description

Write the description following the mandatory format. Before creating, review:

- Is Background one paragraph at a strategic (not implementation) level?
- Are Objectives strategic aims, not tasks?
- Are Key Results measurable?
- Is Out of Scope only present if the user explicitly said something is excluded?

### 4. Create the Ticket

Use `atlassian___createJiraIssue` via the `manage-jira` skill for API mechanics:

- `issueTypeName`: Always `"Initiative"`
- `projectKey`: Ask the user if not obvious from context

### 5. Set Team

Every ticket **must** have a team assigned to appear on the board. Follow the team assignment instructions from the active project skill (e.g. `cars-project`), which contains the correct custom field ID and team UUID resolution steps for the current org.

If no project skill is active, ask the user which team should own this initiative, then set it via `atlassian___editJiraIssue` using the field ID and value format appropriate for the org (see `manage-jira` skill for discovery steps).

## What This Skill Does NOT Cover

- Other issue types (Epic, Story, Bug) -- separate skills.
- Transitioning, editing, or commenting on existing tickets -- use `manage-jira` skill.
- Codebase analysis -- initiatives are strategic and do not require code investigation.
