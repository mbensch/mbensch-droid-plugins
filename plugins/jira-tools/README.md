# Jira Tools

A Factory plugin for Jira issue creation and management via Atlassian MCP tools. Use `/jira-create` to create Initiatives, Epics, Stories, and Bugs with guided intake and optional codebase analysis.

## Installation

### From Marketplace (Recommended)

```bash
# Add the marketplace
droid plugin marketplace add https://github.com/mbensch/mb-ai-tools

# Install the plugin
droid plugin install jira-tools@mb-ai-tools
```

Or use the interactive UI: `/plugins` → Marketplaces → Add marketplace → enter URL

### From Local Directory (Development)

```bash
droid plugin marketplace add /path/to/mb-ai-tools
droid plugin install jira-tools@mb-ai-tools
```

## Prerequisites

Requires the [Atlassian MCP integration](https://app.factory.ai/settings/integrations) to be configured in Factory settings. The `acli` CLI is supported as a fallback for basic operations.

## Commands

### `/jira-create`

The primary entry point for creating any Jira issue type. The command:

1. Detects whether you are inside a git repository
2. Asks what type of issue you want to create (Initiative, Epic, Story, Bug)
3. Gathers your initial description
4. Optionally analyzes the codebase to produce a more accurate ticket (for technical requests in a repo)
5. Delegates to the appropriate create skill, which handles clarifying questions, description formatting, ticket creation, and team assignment

## Skills

### `manage-jira`

General-purpose Jira ticket management. Droid will automatically use this skill when you ask to:

- View, edit, or transition tickets
- Search with JQL
- Add comments
- Set custom fields (team, sprint, story points)
- Bulk operations

Includes a full acli command reference and troubleshooting guide.
